# General/Navigation
launch.instruction=To launch the Fragile Calculator, double click on the FragileCalculator.jar file.
close.instruction=To close the calculator, click the X displayed in either the upper left (macOS) or upper right (Windows/Linux).

# Menu Bar Options
print.file.instruction=Under the \u2018File\u2019 menu option, \u2018Print File\u2019 will bring up a print page that allows you to print all of the calculations you have entered.
mode.option.instruction=The \u2018Mode\u2019 Option lets you toggle if you want the fractions to appear in \u2018Proper\u2019 and/or \u2018Reduced\u2019 form.
view.option.instruction=The \u2018View\u2019 option brings up a new window that displays the last entered expression as a pie chart, which can be more useful for visualizing the operations.
style.option.instruction=The \u2018Style\u2019 option allows you to select whether the fraction bar will appear in Bar, Slash, or Solidus style.
help.option.instruction=The \u2018Help\u2019 option has two options: \u2018About\u2019 launches a new window displaying product information as well as credits, and \u2018Help\u2019 launches a WWW browser and displays these help pages.

# Session History
session.history.instruction=The blue sidebar with an arrow can be clicked on, and it expands into a window displaying the history of entered fractions, performed operations, as well as the results of expressions. The history is able to be copy and pasted for more convenience, and it can also be printed for a physical copy.

# Calculator Functions
calculator.display.instruction=The Calculator contains a main display window, as well as a selection of buttons for number entry, operations, and more.
position.button.instruction=The position button [ / ] allows you to cycle between the whole number, numerator, and denominator positions.
number.button.instruction=The number buttons [0-9], let you enter the corresponding number into the current position.
reset.button.instruction=The Reset button [ R ] clears the entire expression, clearing everything entered.
clear.button.instruction=The Clear button [ C ] clears the current operand only.
backspace.button.instruction=The Backspace button [ \u2190 ] clears only the most recently entered part of the fraction
sign.button.instruction=The Sign Button [ ± ] changes the sign of the fraction, alternating between a positive fraction and negative fraction.
operation.button.instruction=The plus [ + ], minus [ - ], multiply [ * ], and divide [ ÷ ] buttons are used after the first operand is entered, and perform their respective operations.
equals.button.instruction=The equals button [ = ] requires two fractions to be entered, as well as an operation. It then computes and displays the result.
mediant.button.instruction=The Mediant button [ \u21F9 ] is an additional operator button that calculates the mediant of two entered fractions.
integerPower.button.instruction=The IntegerPower button [ x^n ] is another operator and allows you to enter a fraction, and then raise it to any entered power.
simplification.button.instruction=The Simplification button [ \u21A1 ] helps simplify mixed fractions, converting them into improper fractions.
invert.button.instruction=The Invert button [ Inv ] takes the current fraction and switches the numerator and denominator.

# Keyboard Usage
keyboard.usage.instruction=The Calculator also allows the user to use their keyboard to enter data more quickly. You can use either the Numpad or the row of numbers to type the numbers 0-9 and the result is the same as if you clicked the corresponding button. This significantly speeds up your ability to enter fractions and saves time.
keyboard.operations.instruction=The four basic operations can also be entered on your physical keyboard, by pressing the corresponding keys: + for addition, - for subtraction, * for multiplication, and / for division.
decimal.key.instruction=The last important key is the decimal or period key. It can be used interchangeably for the position button, allowing you to quickly switch between the whole number, numerator, or denominator positions.

# Language Support
languageSupport.instruction=The Fragile Calculator also supports different languages based on the user\u2019s locale setting. For example, the Calculator below is translated into French. These help pages are also translated.

# Recording
recording.instruction=The Fragile Calculator is also able to record. The recording can be paused, stopped, and resumed by pressing the corresponding buttons shown below.
playback.instruction=The recordings can also be played back, where the same numbers and operations will be replicated. These can also be paused, stopped, and resumed. The recordings will also automatically be saved if you forget to stop recording before closing the Calculator.

# Intermediate Steps
intermediateSteps.instruction=Just like the session history, the intermediate step window icon (left image) can be clicked on, and it will show each intermediate step taken until the final result (demonstrated in the right image).

# Customization
customization.instruction=The display icon and color scheme for the .jar file can be customized. Inside the resources package, open the text file titled \u2018Customization\u2019. Follow the instructions within to customize the calculator\u2019s colors and logo. There is also a list of common colors in case the user is not familiar with RGB color codes.

# Keyboard Shortcuts
keyboardShortcuts.instruction=The Fragile Calculator allows for customization of keyboard shortcuts, allowing the user to set their own custom shortcuts to perform the desired action. These preferences can also be saved so you do not have to set them each time.

# Comparing Fractions
comparingFractions.instruction=The Fragile Calculator can also be used to compare fractions, and it will display the sign corresponding to greater than, less than, or equal to.
